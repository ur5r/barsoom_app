Web-Machine Sample Application runs on windows 7 Erlang R16A

Wanted to see how easy/difficult it's gonna be to run webmachine on windows 7 and erlang R16A. Managed to get this working 

I personally think all one needs to do is to clone this out and after running the start.sh on cygwin - the next thing to do 

is to call barsoom_app:start(). - then go on to the browser on http://127.0.0.1:8765/ shoud load the hello world page.

Good Luck!
